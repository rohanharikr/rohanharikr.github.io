Before starting, I would like to point that I am not a BJP supporter or any other political party for that matter. I only care about stuff that benefits the interest of India.

**tl;dr: I fully support the government's decision of the ban on Chinese apps.**

**Why the ban?**

All apps on the list are all accused of collecting unauthorized user data (like clipboard and whatnot) and this is not something new.

What we don't know for a fact is whether they are doing this for the interest of a 3rd party, be it any government or corporation but what we do know is that if the government wanted to access this data; by law, they can. Failing to comply with the government puts these companies in trouble because of espionage and national security laws in the country.

_"The 2017 National Intelligence Law and the 2014 Counter-Espionage Law. Article 7 of the first law states that “any organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law."_

This ban was proposed/supported/consulted by/with the Cyber Security Team of India (Ministry of Information Technology, Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, Computer Emergency Response Team).

**People oppossing / ridiculing the ban.**

**Why now?**

Why invite unnecessary attention and issues? Well, no country would do that specifically against a county under normal circumstances.

But in my personal opinion, apps like these which pose a threat should be banned regardless of what the situation of the country is, even if its going to attract unwanted attention.

**Response.**

Should we lecture him about the censorship in China? How can he make such a statement when his own country has one of the world's most aggressive censorship systems in place, admittedly for one of the reasons as ours.

Oh wait, forgot that even Wikipedia is blocked. If China ever decides to relieve its censorships, the aforementioned is something you might want to consider reading.
