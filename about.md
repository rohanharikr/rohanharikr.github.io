### About

I’m rohan and this is my personal website. I like to play random notes, move code around, play with pixels, and wonder, “am I creating art?” The answer is no.

##### What is a personal website?

It’s like your Facebook profile, but you have to pay the servers to be ignored by humanity.

##### What do you do?

I am 1/3 of Mighty Noodles, also managing frontend and design.

##### What do you do? pt.2

I'm really into opensource, tinkering and hacking. I'm an active member of the Mozilla Developer Network. I play guitar, record songs, and die n times in Dark Souls. I love sim games like RCT, Stardew Valley, and Factorio. Also, glory to Arstotzka! 

##### Five years from now, where do you see yourself?

<p>Five years from now, I get to see myself be <span id="update">...</span> years of age. I dedicate my life to gift my family the best lives possible, bring happiness and joy to many people's lives, build advanced pointless machines™, live in Iceland, and create videogames and music which I can be proud of.</p>

##### Show me some code
```
const helloWorld = () => {
	window.open('https://github.com/rohanharikr')}
```

<h4>Anything else?</h4>
<p>Nothing much, says rohan. He wanted to let you know that he is really happy you took the time to read this.</p>
