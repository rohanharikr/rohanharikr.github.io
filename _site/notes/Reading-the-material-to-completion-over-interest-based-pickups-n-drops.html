  <li>And in another way, this is just pure incompetence that is being rationalized as efficient mechanism to imbibe knowledge. Doesn't provide authority, doesn't allow for legitimacy, all it does is allows you to create an echo chamber for yourself where you can engage in a pseudo-random verbal-diarrhea with like minded people.</li>

<p>That said, it should be noted that switching books based on interest is not wrong, caution must be applied while talking about topics that you yourself have not completely gone through.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Remember any resource that you pick up is someone's sweat and blood. If you do not wish to read it, always make sure not to form opinions on it, or at least not to promulgate any partial information on it. Always try to put yourself in such a situation and see how you'd have taken it — The Silver Rule.</p>

<p>Most of the time our inability to read to completion has to do with association of the act of reading instead of the book that we are read, context-switching can really here. Also <span class="tooltip"><a href="/notes/Reading-with-fractalized-mental-pattern">Reading with fractalized mental pattern</a><span class="right bottom"><span class="tooltip-title">Reading with fractalized mental pattern</span><br/><span class="tooltip-excerpt">Fractalize your mental patterns instead of reading as a whole (i.e., one single pattern, where the mood of the act is associated with the ego), that way you will be able to selectively associate yourself with a book instead of the act of reading. Most people stop reading when they are bored of reading, but by fractalizing your mental patterns you will be able to dissociate yourself from that particular book and move on to another book instead of stopping reading altogether.<br />
