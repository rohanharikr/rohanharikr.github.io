      "content"  : "I finished my first walkthrough of Bloodborne. I know that I am late to the party. I recently got back into playing games after convincing myself that I didn't enjoy it as much as before; felt I grew out of that phase. The only kind of games I enjoyed playing then were strategy games. The reason being most of the games in the market were very shallow, linear story-driven. Whereas a game like Dota had infinite possibilities.\n\nBut thankfully, FromSoft revived my love for gaming. I started to give some of my time for Dark Souls 3 given all the hype and how it was difficult and so on. I was thrown a challenge in the very first minutes of the game. It took me several tries to even kill the \"allegedly\" tutorial boss. I was hooked and the rest is history.\n\nFromSoft defined the benchmark for games. I am very confident to say there are only a handful of studios present now to utilize the medium to the fullest. Finishing Dark Souls, I wanted more of it. So I jumped to the obvious selection, Sekiro. Another amazing game. I cannot write about Sekiro or Dark Souls with the same emotion as Bloodborne because this is a game I finished just hours ago and I haven't stopped thinking about it although, most of the games share a similar FromSoft formula. You know you can expect good lore, characters, and mysteries.\n\nMost of what I have to say about Bloodborne is emotions and it is very hard for me to put that into words.\n\nBloodborne is one of the best games I have ever played and my favorite FromSoft game. I understand why it has such an awesome fanbase. Let's talk about lore. The team created something surreal, simply epic. How everything is connected. Of course, not everything is engraved in stone and almost everything is open for interpretation. Note when I point out all FromSoft games, I mean the games after Demons' Souls; the game which put FromSoft as a unique and inspiring game studio. Thanks to Miyazaki, his vision and the team for defining a genre and a generation.\n\nBloodborne starts very vaguely just like most of all FromSoft games. I just started playing knowing that something greater was definitely in store. That's the From factor and From always delivers.\n\nBloodborne is one of a kind and I don't know where to start honestly. Everything about this game is creepy. I felt like a hunter. The world was so immersive and scary that I was cautious almost all the time. I knew there was a bird with a dog's head or a dog with a bird's head around the corner. Some parts were so creepy that I had to run to the next lamp. The serpent forest always gets me. I am pretty sure that there must be at least one aspect of Bloodborne which gives you the chills.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics and world design are spectacular and well-thought just like the other games. Everything felt like it had a purpose. The characters and RPG aspects were compelling. The cutscenes although very little were spot on and added to the creepiness of the gameplay. Really good game design and writing.\n\nI felt a sense of duty and responsibility. Most of the conversations with my friends end with \"I must save Yharnam now\". That's how invested I was in this game. I love Micolash. His dialogues are super cool and creepy. I used to utter the cutscene dialogues just to weird out my parents. I was living and breathing this game for a while. It's true when people say games are an escape. You get to be someone you cannot. Only games can do that in its fullest sense.\n\nAfter watching Vaati's videos, I was even more intrigued about all the stuff I missed and which made no sense at the time of playing. Everything was slowly coming together. I mean the people at FromSoft had to smoke some weird stuff to come up with this. It is that good. Bloodborne's details and lore is insane and beyond decipherable for a casual player like me. You have to go through wikis, speculations, and Vaati's video to get a sense of what is happening and why it is happening.\n\nGames like these teach you to keep trying in life, no matter what and in the end, it would be well worth it. I also read a lot of articles on Sekiro and why it should have an easy mode / make it more accessible. This would go against the creator's vision and if something is easy, it would not be worth it. It's meant to be played the way it was made to be played. When I am talking about the way to be played, I am not talking about the gameplay or the routes they have to take but the vision on how the game should feel like. Only if these people who write these articles tried. Life is not easy. Nothing comes easy. You have to fight and earn.\n\nWhen the First Hunter started playing, I was getting goosebumps. I really felt proud to be a hunter. Even if you haven't played, you can get a good sense of the whole picture just from this soundtrack; the raw emotion behind it.\n\n\nAtomicThunderbolt · Bloodborne  ~ The First Hunter\n\nThe bosses are amazing. The soundtracks are spot on. I took my time with this game realizing this was the only remaining FromSoftware game I wanted to play apart from Elden Ring, Demon's Souls Remake whose release date is still not officially announced (and also Dark Souls Remastered). Hoping Elden Ring to be showcased in Gamescon considering that Bandai Namco (Elden Rings publisher) is going to be there. Playing Bloodborne pushed me to start reading Lovecraft. It's amazing how people can even come up with stuff like this. This is way beyond something I can ever imagine. Thank you for the unforgettable experience.\n\nSo in short words, Bloodborne is a masterpiece."

      "title"    : "Starting my game development journey",
      "url"      : "/posts/starting-my-game-dev-journey",
      "content"  : "Part #1 of the gamedev series\n\nCurrent Mood\n\nKit_1998 · You Were There (ICO)\n\nI have been in front of the computer playing computer games as long as I can remember. My early memories of playing videogames are on the GBA emulator exploring the epic worlds of Pokemon, Beyblade and, Dragon Ball Z. I have spent countless hours playing Wild Ambition on my neighbor's Playstation 1. After many fights and nirahara samarams (hunger strikes), my dad finally decided to buy us a Playstation 2 but we were a little late to the party cause we got our hands on the PS2 when the PS3 was released but that was okay. PS2 was still damn popular and one of the best consoles yet with an enormous collection of games.\n\nAt this point, I played games as just games without giving much thought into how it was made. It was around this time I came to know about the best game on the platform - Shadow of the Colossus, from the legendary game designer, Fumito Ueda. I did not get a chance to play this on the PS2 but got a chance to play and finish the remade version for the PS4. I was broken. The controls were buggy, the horse is unresponsive and lots of other issues. But in the end, the story slowly starts to come together and bam hits you in the face. The ending left me in tears. The music by Kow Otani, another legend composed a perfect soundtrack for the game. Come to think of it, Fumito intentionally decided to make agro (the horse) less responsive because if agro just respond to everything you do, then it would be just robotic. He was just trying to emulate the real world. Pets don't listen all the time. These minor details got me started about designing games. The art, music, code, story, gameplay which goes into these is insane.\n\nI am also a big fan of Hidetaka-san and his work. The Soulsbourne series and Sekiro push the limitation of games. I find many games today not fully utilizing the medium. Videogames are the ultimate form of storytelling and very few designers have harnessed this. Just taking the world of Dark Souls as an example, the game itself offers very little direct storytelling. Everything about the world is immersive. Everything is up to the player, from figuring out the story and what's happening by observing the world and the mechanics. This open to tons of interpretations too. Games like Ico, SotC, The Last Guardian, etc are benchmarks and push how we tell stories through games.\n\nAnother inspiration for me is ConcernedApe aka Eric Barone, Chris Sawyer for what they have achieved technically and artistically. Just to process the fact that Stardew Valley was written entirely by one person is just amazing and motivating.\n\nAll these inspired me to make games. But it's hard for me to even believe that a song inspired me to make the game that I am going to make. Its an album by Sigur Ros called Route One. It is instrumental and plays for 24hrs. There is something very mysterious, eerie about this album that got me to thinking how it would look like on screen. That's the beauty of art. One medium can inspire another. But then again, everything is art.\n\nBuckethead is also a great inspiration. I love mysteries and decoding stuff without someone spoon-feeding me. Not only does this give the player more freedom, but also gives him/her a sense of achievement and satisfaction. Music by Buckethead teaches me to enjoy the little things in life. I started to see the world differently. It's beautiful how songs with no vocals can still have influence.\n\nComing back to the first line, I have been playing games for so long and now, I have decided to finally make one. I want to do everything by myself from writing the code, creating art and music. I have very little knowledge of all the aspects of making a game so this would also be a good way to improve.\n\nTo design a game, you have to be open-minded. I consider myself to be an asshole but every day I am trying to be better. I am. I have been so arrogant and ignorant that every time I think about something of the past (that I would never do now), I just want to drop dead. I always hated music other than the traditional stuff, for example, electronic and despised others who listen to stuff that I don't listen to. I have been such an ignoramus and feel sad and pity for my past self. Games like SDV have got me thinking about synth music and its beauty. Everything is beautiful. Everything is different and what makes us different make us beautiful. Some of my friends (I don't even know how or why they want to be friends with someone like me but I am glad that they are/were) ask me why I always disappear and I always give some lame reply. But the real reason is that I want to get away from my past self and whatever I did. It's hard to face that. I want to start fresh. I want to be a ghost.\n\nI am not a good artist, heck not even an average one. I am choosing pixel art because the entry-level to that is low compared to high-quality 2d or 3d. I have played guitar for more than 7 years but I am ashamed to say that I don't know anything about it. I just play. Some people have the natural ability to understand and do. Understand why some things are the way they are. I am on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nI am afraid that I won't be able to complete this project. This is a very ambitious one. I am just working on an idea. I have a vision on how the game should play, feel, and look like but do not know how to get there. There is no roadmap, no goals; just progressing step by step. Building as I go in the hope that it will all come together hopefully.\n\nI am lazier than 99% of the people. I lose motivation very quickly. My attention span is scarily low. For the past couple of months, I have even lost the motivation to wake up. For someone with these traits, it's hard to create a game. Creating a game is insanely difficult. So, this would be a challenge for me. I quit easily. I do not want to. I am going to set a target and will achieve it even if at any point, I feel like what I am making is terrible and not even worth the time. I need to push myself.\n\nI am starting this series to inspire me to keep making the game regardless of people reading it or not. The more I invest in something, the more it is harder to get out and that is exactly what I am intending to do. I want to put my life into this that it should feel like my life depends on it. I am not looking for any commercial success or fame. I am not doing this to prove anything.\n\nI am doing this for myself. To tell myself 20 years from now that I have made something, achieved something in life. Something worthy to even mention because sadly, I don't have anything right now.\n\n“We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.”\n\n― Confucius\n\nMy only dream before I die is to be genuinely proud of something I create and if it brings happiness to others too, I will be thrilled. I also want to make my parents proud who have been supporting me regardless of my ups and downs. I also want it to do it for them.\n\nI will be documenting my work once in a while. I have set up the environment. As of now, using Lua and the love2d framework because I found it fairly straightforward. Tried multiple game engines, frameworks but love2d with Lua scored the goal for me. The gameplay style I am going for would be closer to Miyazaki-sans works."

      "content"  : "This first thing that comes to my mind when I think about pocket money is Vishu which is a festival we celebrate in Kerala. On this day, there is a tradition of giving young people money. Although Vishu marks the first day of Medam, the ninth month in the Malayalam calendar (yes, I googled this), I believe this day also signifies the rotation of wealth.\n\nWriting this stuff brings back so many memories. The day starts by our mom (we are 2 siblings) waking us up early in the morning and telling us to keep our eyes closed as she takes us to show us the statue of a Hindu deity decorated with flowers and other beautiful articles. Then she hands each of us a rupee note (of 100/500 denomination). That’s how the day starts!\n\nWe were a tightly packed society meaning all my friends were in the same neighborhood. So after receiving these “vishumoney” (this is what we used to call it) from our dad and grandparents we would run off to our friends’ house.\n\nP.S (but not really) grandparents used to give us the largest amount.\n\nYou can think of it like Halloween but instead of candies, its money and exclusive to Kerala. At the end of the day, me and and brother would add our “collections” and make a list on what to spend it on. If we were unable to spend it on anything, we would just return it to our parents i.e after Vishu of course!\n\nI didn’t require any “pocket money” in my childhood as everything was available and provided at home only.\n\nIn the old days, elder people used to only give coins to younger folk but you know these days, because of inflation and all… (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)"

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up….The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.  …As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards…The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.  …Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting…And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., the leprechaun throw.  There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay’s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of — the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance.

Google claims in its [[android developer guide that dark themes can improve visibility for people who have low vision and are sensititive to brightness::https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme]], but people I have spoken to on this topic (n≈20) had normal vision and normal range of sensitivity to light.Even people with mild eye issues[[Jason Harrison, UBC - People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white.::lsn]] seem to benefit from light theme than dark theme in most cases. And to top it all, even the researches that focus on the legibility[[Bauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R. (1980). Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal. See Below for more.::rsn]] and aesthetics claim that dark on light is almost always better than dark on light. Every article I have read and referenced below vouch for dark on light, which I find to be true too at least in most occasions.How can what is relatively bad for legibility in most ocassions, bad in terms of expressibility of authorial aesthetics be a wide-spread preference? My hypothesis is this is primarily due to cognitive exhaustion like sleep deprivation, burn-out, stress etc (Extrapolating from n=1), which due to implicity conformity and [[preference falsification::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification]] has become a normative social element. My experience has been that when I have had a bad last night sleep or stress due to office, I invariably am looking for less polarity, otherwise the dark on white seems more appealing to me both aesthetics wise and legibility wise. An extension of these could be that cognitive stress elevate the ocular stress like accomodative/refractive/convergence stress leading up to this, but I contest dark mode being the wide-spread personal/subjective preference.ReferencesBauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R. (1980). Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal.(From: [[UX Stackexchange on theme and eye strain::https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes]])  \"…However, most studies have shown that dark characters on a light background are superior to light characters on a dark background (when the refresh rate is fairly high). For example, Bauer and Cavonius (1980) found that participants were 26% more accurate in reading text when they read it with dark characters on a light background…\"Pabini Gabriel-Petit. (2007). [[Applying color theory to digital displays::https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/01/applying-color-theory-to-digital-displays.php]]  \"…While white text on a black background provides very high value contrast, it is less readable and causes greater eye fatigue than black text on a white background…\"Jason Harrison – Post Doctoral Fellow, Imager Lab Manager – Sensory Perception and Interaction Research Group, University of British Columbia  People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white. Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the \"deformed\" lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.Raluca Budiu. (2020). [[Dark mode v Light Mode: Which is better::https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/]]  \"…Their results showed that light mode won across all dimensions: irrespective of age, the positive contrast polarity was better for both visual-acuity tasks and for proofreading tasks. However, the difference between light mode and dark mode in the visual-acuity task was smaller for older adults than for younger adults — meaning that, although light mode was better for older adults, too, they did not benefit from it as much as younger adults, at least in the visual-acuity task.  When researchers looked at fatigue metrics, they concluded that there was no significant difference of contrast polarity on any of them (meaning that it wasn’t the case that dark mode made people more tired, or vice versa)…\"Lauren V.

      "content"  : "To improve as a programmer, every programmer whether working independently or in an organization should atleast have one project that they control 100% of, and it doesn't matter if it is your main project or a side project. When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can't. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn't work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won't. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable.  Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don't like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can't.Related: [[Creativity is a quality without a name]]ReferencesAndreas Kling.

This is based on the idea by Kurzban et. al that overcommiting to a task, that is only expected to show its result in distant future, can dissolve will power to an extent of a burnout or complete unproductivity. And in my opinion, it not just affects the quantifiable components, it also affects your qualitative components like creative autonomy.After talking with few interesting people and trying out various different processes myself I have come to the conclusion that some of the strategies mentioned below can help in persistance of motivation in a long term personal project without any unnatural self-enforced adherence.
