Before starting, I would like to point that I am not a BJP supporter or any other political party for that matter. I only care about stuff that benefit to the betterment of India.

I fully support the government's decision to ban these apps bsaed out of China.

**Let us understand why we banned these apps?**

All apps on the ban list are of accused of stealing user data. This is nothing new. 

"Apple catches TikTok secretly spying on millions of iPhone users. In iOS 14 Beta, one of these features is a new banner alert that lets users know if an app is pasting from the clipboard. And, Apple caught TikTok reading user clipboards."

What we know for fact is that TikTok and the other apps do steal data and Chinese laws allow the government to snoop, get the data collected from TikTok etc. Failing to comply with the government's policies puts these companies in trouble because of espionage and national security laws in the country.

"The 2017 National Intelligence Law and the 2014 Counter-Espionage Law. Article 7 of the first law states that any organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law."

**Was it the sole decision of government to ban these apps?**

No, this ban was supported by the cyber security team of India.

**All these people against the ban?**

I feel nothing but pity for them. These were the same people who were complaining about privacy and security in Arogya Sethu.

arogya sethu went open source...

now they rise from the graves again just to go on another rant about banning chinese apps

remember these were the same people who were crying about privacy and now they dont seem to give a shit

im guessing they are just looking for the attention they lack at home.

why invite unnecessary attention and issues. also doing it for the wrong reason? - im afraid this guys doesnt have the intellecutal capacity to differentiate between right and wrong. hoping he is not aware about the border tensions and the possibilty of a war. if he is, then god save him. but he is right to some extent. apps like these which pose a threat should be banned even if its going to attract unwanted attention.

well, no country would do that specifically against a county under normal circumstances.

although i agree to that fact that bans like these which pose a major security test (also proven) should be banner regardless of what the situation of the country is.

i would rather be with my government that their, i would rather trust my government that theirs.

this journalist from china who has battery for a brain recently tweeted this after ban he had the audacity?

he do realise he is living in china right, where almost all the social media apps are banned for the same reason we banned ours. is he stupid?

india banned these apps, great. all these people who are arguing about it, if you call yourself a patriot then you wouldnt be against. but lets say you are still, then i would ask "are you not?"

he so called intellectuals opposed Aadhaar linking, citing "privacy concerns" Ok fine. Now, the same intellectuals are opposing ban on TikTok, despite knowing that various security issues and privacy concerns with TikTok which have surfaced now and then
