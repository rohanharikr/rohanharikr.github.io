Before starting, I would like to point that I am not a BJP supporter or any other political party for that matter. I only care about stuff that benefits the interest of India.

**tl;dr: I fully support the governments decision of the ban on the Chinese apps.**

**Why the ban?**

All apps on the list are all accused of collecting unauthorized user data (like clipboard and whatnot) and this is not something new.

What we don't know for a fact is whether they are doing this for the ineterest of a 3rd party, be it any government or corporation but what we do know is that if the government wanted to access this data; by law, they can. Failing to comply with the government puts these companies in trouble because of espionage and national security laws in the country. 

_"The 2017 National Intelligence Law and the 2014 Counter-Espionage Law. Article 7 of the first law states that â€œany organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law."_

This ban was proposed / supported / consulted by / with the Cyber Security Team of India (Ministry of Information Technology, Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, Commputer Emergency Response Team).

**People oppossing / ridiculing the ban.**

**Why now?**

Why invite unnecessary attention and issues? Well, no country would do that specifically against a county under normal circumstances.

But in my personal opinion, apps like these which pose a threat should be banned regardless of what the situation of the country is, even if its going to attract unwanted attention.

**Closing notes.**
