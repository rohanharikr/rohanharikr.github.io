title: Hi there!
---

<p>I’m Rohan, a developer (a ui developer) and this is my personal website. I like to play random notes in a guitar, play with pixels, and wonder, “am I creating art?” The answer is no.</p>

<h4>What is a personal website?</h4>

It’s like your Facebook profile, but you have to pay the servers to be ignored by humanity.

<h4>What do you do?</h4>

I’m currently working at Kaarva, India's best fintech platform based out of Bangalore.
<br>
I manage design here (paper → code).

<h4>What do you do? pt.2</h4>

I'm really into opensource, tinkering and hacking. I'm an active member of the Mozilla Developer Network. I play guitar, record songs, and die n times in Dark Souls. I love sim games like RCT, Stardew Valley, and Factorio. Also, glory to Arstotzka! 

<h4>Five years from now, where do you see yourself?</h4>

Five years from now, I get to see myself be 25 years of age. I dedicate my life to gift my family the best lives possible, bring happiness and joy to many people's lives, build advanced pointless machines™, live in Iceland, and create videogames and music which I can be proud of.

<h4>Show me some code</h4>
<code>function codeJam() {</code>
<code>window.open('https://github.com/rohanharikr')</code>
<code>}</code>	

<h4>Anything else?</h4>
<p>Nothing much, says Rohan. He wanted to let you know that he is really happy you took the time to read this paragraph.</p>
